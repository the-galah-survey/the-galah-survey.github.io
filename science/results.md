### Data Releases
The GALAH Survey has had three data releases, each aimed to leverage data releases from the Gaia mission.

#### Data Release 1
The GALAH survey published our first data release on 9 September 2016. It contains data for 9860 stars that were likely to be included in the first Gaia data release as part of its TGAS data set. It contained stellar parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], [α/Fe]), radial velocity, distance modulus and reddening.

#### Data Release 2
The GALAH survey published our second data release on 18 April 2018. It contains data for 342,682 stars with up to 23 elemental abundances per star.

#### Data Release 3
The GALAH survey published our third data release on 6 November 2020. GALAH DR3 contained stellar parameters and elemental abundances from 678,423 spectra for 588,571 stars that have been observed with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope between November 2013 and February 2019. DR3 was the first GALAH data release to include reduced one-dimensional spectra for the stars. There are two main catalogues that contain stellar parameters and elemental abundances for up to 30 elements per star: Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu.

### Key results
The [GALAH Survey has published 38 refereed papers](/science/galah_publications), with a further eight in submission.




The GALAH team has already published 25 refereed papers, with 2 more currently being refereed and several others in progress. In [4], we delivered the largest high quality catalog of radial velocities, reaching an impressive precision of 0.1 km/s (an order of magnitude better than Gaia DR2 for stars at the same magnitude). Some major science highlights include the detailed dissection of the stellar discs in terms of age, velocity, action, and location with GALAH chemistry ([5], [6]). In [7], GALAH performed the first detailed elemental abundance follow-up of Gaia’s discovery of the “phase spiral” perturbation in the local disc1, a spiral pattern seen in phase space ([8]) due to the Sagittarius dwarf’s interaction with the Galaxy. GALAH made the first demonstration of blind cluster chemical tagging ([9], [10]) as well as disproving the reality of several high-latitude, open clusters whose origin was a mystery ( [11]). We presented evidence for differing abundance trends between the thin and thick disc as well as with metallicity and age ( [5], [12]). [13] showed that the velocity fluctuations in the Galaxy are quite small, contradicting previous measurements, and this has important consequences for determining the local standard of rest. Further, GALAH championed the use of unsupervised classification with t-SNE to detect peculiar objects using stellar spectra ([14]). Using GALAH, we resolved the puzzling disagreement of Li-measurements with predictions from Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [38]. In [39], we deduced the fundamental relations governing the velocity dispersion of stars in terms of age, angular momentum, and metallicity.
