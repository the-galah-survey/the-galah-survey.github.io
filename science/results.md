The GALAH team has already published 25 refereed papers, with 2 more currently being refereed and several others in progress. In [4], we delivered the largest high quality catalog of radial velocities, reaching an impressive precision of 0.1 km/s (an order of magnitude better than Gaia DR2 for stars at the same magnitude). Some major science highlights include the detailed dissection of the stellar discs in terms of age, velocity, action, and location with GALAH chemistry ([5], [6]). In [7], GALAH performed the first detailed elemental abundance follow-up of Gaia’s discovery of the “phase spiral” perturbation in the local disc1, a spiral pattern seen in phase space ([8]) due to the Sagittarius dwarf’s interaction with the Galaxy. GALAH made the first demonstration of blind cluster chemical tagging ([9], [10]) as well as disproving the reality of several high-latitude, open clusters whose origin was a mystery ( [11]). We presented evidence for differing abundance trends between the thin and thick disc as well as with metallicity and age ( [5], [12]). [13] showed that the velocity fluctuations in the Galaxy are quite small, contradicting previous measurements, and this has important consequences for determining the local standard of rest. Further, GALAH championed the use of unsupervised classification with t-SNE to detect peculiar objects using stellar spectra ([14]). Using GALAH, we resolved the puzzling disagreement of Li-measurements with predictions from Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [38]. In [39], we deduced the fundamental relations governing the velocity dispersion of stars in terms of age, angular momentum, and metallicity.
