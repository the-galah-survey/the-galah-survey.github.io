The GALAH Survey has been working for almost a decade to reveal the rich history of our Milky Way Galaxy by studying the current positions, motions, ages and chemistry of stars formed at different times and in different locations. This page summarizes some of the major discoveries that the GALAH Survey has enabled.

### Key results
Data from the GALAH Survey has been used in over 170 publications, with these publications receiving nearly 2500 citations. Check out the full list of [publications from the GALAH team](/science/galah_publications) and [other astronomers working with GALAH data](/science/external_publications).

Below we highlight a few of the interesting science results found using GALAH.

#### Dissection of the stellar discs
The GALAH survey has allowed for the detailed dissection of the stellar discs in terms of age, velocity, action, and location.
* [Bland-Hawthorn *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.486.1167B/abstract) used GALAH data to recover the remarkable 'phase spiral' discovered by Gaia.
* [Bennett & Bovy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.1417B/abstract) in part used GALAH radial velocities to measure waves in the vertical density and velocities of stars near the Sun.
* [Belokurov *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.494.3880B/abstract) used GALAH data to map out the properties of the principle Galactic components such as the 'thin' and 'thick' discs and the halo.

#### The accreted halo
The Gaia mission has enabled the remarkable discovery that a large fraction of the stars near the Solar neighbourhood are debris from one or more accretion events. GALAH has been at the forefront of providing radial velocities and abundances to help untangle the complicated kinematic structure of the halo.
* [Necib *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...903...25N/abstract) used GALAH data to identify a possible accretion event known as Nyx. Though in a follow-up paper [Zucker *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912L..30Z/abstract) also used GALAH data to find that Nyx was likely just thick disk stars.
* [Dodd *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210509957D/abstract) and [Limberg *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210505958L/abstract) studied in detail the structure and properties of nearby debris associated with the Helmi streams.
* [Matsuno *et al*](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210107791M/abstract) used GALAH r-process element measurements to show that accreted stars from Gaia-Enceladus clearly show higher ratios of [Eu/Mg] than *in-situ* stars.
* [Simpson et al](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.491.3374S/abstract) chemically tagged the Fimbulthul stellar stream to the massive globular cluster ω Centauri.


#### Lithium


Using GALAH, we resolved the puzzling disagreement of Li-measurements with predictions from Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [38].
* [Martell et al](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp.1346M/abstract) carried out a census of lithium-rich giant stars in the Milky Way, finding that red clump stars are 2.5 times as likely to be lithium-rich as red giant branch star.
* [Simpson et al](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201102659S/abstract) showed with GALAH measurements of lithium abundances that accreted stars also live on the Spite Plateau.

### Data Releases
The GALAH Survey has had three data releases, each aimed to leverage data releases from the Gaia mission.

#### Data Release 1
The GALAH survey published our First Data Release on 9 September 2016. It contains data for 9860 stars that were likely to be included in the first Gaia data release as part of its TGAS data set. It contained stellar parameters (Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], [α/Fe]), radial velocity, distance modulus and reddening. [Martel *et al* (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.465.3203M/abstract), which describes DR1 has been cited over 100 times.

#### Data Release 2
The GALAH survey published our Second Data Release on 18 April 2018. It contains data for 342,682 stars with up to 23 elemental abundances per star. [Buder *et al* (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478.4513B/abstract), which describes DR2 has been cited nearly 200 times, and is higlighted by Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society in their [collection of highly-cited papers](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/highly_cited_articles) that showcase the breadth of top-quality research published by MNRAS.

#### Data Release 3
The GALAH survey published our Third Data Release on 6 November 2020. GALAH DR3 contained stellar parameters and elemental abundances from 678,423 spectra for 588,571 stars that have been observed with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope between November 2013 and February 2019. DR3 was the first GALAH data release to include reduced one-dimensional spectra for the stars. There are two main catalogues that contain stellar parameters and elemental abundances for up to 30 elements per star: Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu. [Buder *et al* (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp.1259B/abstract), which describes DR3 already has over 30 citations.

<!-- The GALAH team has already published 25 refereed papers, with 2 more currently being refereed and several others in progress. In [4], we delivered the largest high quality catalog of radial velocities, reaching an impressive precision of 0.1 km/s (an order of magnitude better than Gaia DR2 for stars at the same magnitude). Some major science highlights include the detailed dissection of the stellar discs in terms of age, velocity, action, and location with GALAH chemistry ([5], [6]). In [7], GALAH performed the first detailed elemental abundance follow-up of Gaia’s discovery of the “phase spiral” perturbation in the local disc1, a spiral pattern seen in phase space ([8]) due to the Sagittarius dwarf’s interaction with the Galaxy. GALAH made the first demonstration of blind cluster chemical tagging ([9], [10]) as well as disproving the reality of several high-latitude, open clusters whose origin was a mystery ( [11]). We presented evidence for differing abundance trends between the thin and thick disc as well as with metallicity and age ( [5], [12]). [13] showed that the velocity fluctuations in the Galaxy are quite small, contradicting previous measurements, and this has important consequences for determining the local standard of rest. Further, GALAH championed the use of unsupervised classification with t-SNE to detect peculiar objects using stellar spectra ([14]). Using GALAH, we resolved the puzzling disagreement of Li-measurements with predictions from Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [38]. In [39], we deduced the fundamental relations governing the velocity dispersion of stars in terms of age, angular momentum, and metallicity. -->
