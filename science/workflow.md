title: Workflow: From Stellar Light to Abundances
---

How do we estimate stellar elemental abundances from stellar light? Let's explore our workflow with images:

|:-------------:|
| **Target Selection** |
| With our survey, we aim to observe up to 1 million stars. The Milky Way has an estimated amount of 100 billion stars. So which stars should we observe? There are several things to consider: How much light can our telescope (in our case the 3.9m diameter Anglo-Australian Telescope) capture? What data quality do we need to measure stellar abundances of stars? That depends highly on a lot of very technical details how much do we disperse the light to resolve absorption lines (keyword: resolution)? What types of stars are we most interested in and how can we select them best (before taking their spectra)? We have thought about this a lot and decided to select stars with a magnitude 9 to 14. Magnitudes are logarithmic quantities that tell us how bright object are. As an example: The Sun has a magnitude of −26.74, the full moon −12.90, the brightest stars Sirius has −1.47, Vega has 0, the Andromeda Galaxy has +3.44, and our 2nd closest star Proxima Centauri has +11.05.

Absorption lines, like the strong Halpha line in the left third of each spectrum are dark black lines and are wiggling from star to star due to their motion away from us or towards us.](../../assets/img/ccd3.png "Part of a raw image of CCD3 with spectra going horizontally") Image Credit: The GALAH Survey|
