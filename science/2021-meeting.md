### Meeting Rationale

The GALAH Survey is an ongoing, ambitious stellar spectroscopic survey of the local Galactic volume, acquiring high-resolution optical spectra for over one million stars with the HERMES spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. GALAH had its Third Data Release in November 2020, which provided reduced spectra, stellar parameters, elemental abundances, and radial velocities for about 600000 stars. Subsequent to this release was the Third Early Data Release from the Gaia astrometric mission. The combination of these two data releases has provided an unprecedented view of our Galaxy. This conference aimed to bring together researchers to present the latest research taking place using the GALAH survey, Gaia, and other stellar surveys.

This conference used a hybrid format with over 200 registrations from around the world. About 20 people in Sydney were able to meet in-person on the campus of the University of New South Wales in Sydney on 22 June and first half of 23 June 2021. Unfortunately a small COVID-19 cluster meant we moved the conference to fully online for the rest of 23 June and all of 24 June. The conference ran from 9 am to 6 pm Australian Eastern Time each day, so people from around the world joined when they were able to. We had a session in the Australian morning for the Americas to join, and a session in the Australian afternoon for the Europeans to join.

### Acknowledgement of Country

The in-person component of the 2021 GALAH Survey Science Meeting took on place on the unceded territory of the Bedegal peoples. We pay our respect to their elders past and present and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who joined us.

Currently, there is a severe lack of theoretical models that can capture the detailed physics that drives spreads in stellar abundance patterns. In particular, no models are capable of a direct, star-by-star comparison to observed abundances with a detailed treatment of stellar yields. We are working to change that. We present an initial overview of the Aeos project, the first hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of early galaxy formation that models feedback from individual stars and traces detailed elemental abundances. This project is ongoing but will provide insight into early galactic chemical evolution in dwarf galaxies and help us interpret observations of our own stellar halo.</small></td>

A widely utilized strategy to find the remnants of these primordial building blocks is to search for their clumping in phase space. The first discovery of a kinematically-cohesive group of stars with this method was reported in a seminal work by Helmi et al. (1999). Throughout the years, this substructure has been known as the Helmi stream (hereafter "HStr''). Intending to find additional fragments of small systems accreted by the Galaxy, we recently conducted a detailed orbital analysis of ~1500 very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] < -2.0) halo stars. In the process, we confirmed that many of these objects are compatible with HStr, populating its VMP tail with significant numbers. Most important, we found that several stars enhanced in rapid-neutron-capture (r-process; [Eu/Fe] > +0.3 and [Ba/Eu] < 0.0) elements are apparently associated with the stream. Following this clue, we utilized the combination between Gaia EDR3 and GALAH+ DR3 surveys to identify additional members of HStr spanning a considerably wider (by ~0.5 dex) metallicity interval (-2.5 < [Fe/H] < -1.0) than previously reported. We demonstrate that stars of HStr compose a clear declining sequence in [alpha/Fe] for increasing metallicity up to [Fe/H] ~ -1.0, in conformity with a shared chemical-evolution history. Moreover, every vetted star with [Fe/H] < -1.2 is r-process enhanced, providing remarkable evidence that, at such low-metallicity regime, the progenitor of HStr experienced enrichment in neutron-capture elements predominantly through this nucleosynthesis channel (perhaps via neutron-star mergers). Finally, the extended metallicity range further suggests an increase in [Ba/Eu] for higher [Fe/H], also indicative of a dwarf-galaxy origin. Given the available data, we can assert that this stellar stream constitutes the fragments of an ancient dwarf galaxy that was almost completely disrupted by its gravitational interaction with the Milky Way.</small></td>

However, there is growing evidence that the MW’s formation history sets it apart from its sister galaxy, Andromeda (M31), calling its status as a template into question. A direct way to probe galaxy formation history is through chemical abundance measurements of individual stars. Until recently, such measurements were not available in M31, limiting the extent to which M31 could serve as a true complement to the MW. In this talk, I will present the first alpha-element abundance measurements of individual red giant branch stars in the inner halo of M31, including its Giant Stellar Stream (GSS). With measurements for over 200 individual stars, the Elemental Abundances in M31 survey has produced the largest homogeneous set of chemical abundance measurements in M31 to date. In particular, I will discuss how the abundance properties of the GSS, such as its negative metallicity gradient and high average alpha-enhancement, relate to the properties of the GSS progenitor and provide evidence in favor of a recent major merger scenario for the GSS's formation. I will also discuss the implications of these results for differences between the accretion history of M31 and the MW, focusing on comparisons between the GSS and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage merger events.</small></td>

To obtain insights into the relative contributions of different metal-enrichment sources in the early Universe, we select candidates of old nearby halo stars based on GALAH and Gaia EDR3. Using elemental abundance data from GALAH for the candidate old halo stars, we investigate stellar and supernova yield models of the first (metal-free) stars' supernovae, normal core-collapse supernovae, and Type Ia supernovae that explain observed abundances. We find that for the stars with [Fe/H] >-1.5, the models with contributions from both normal core-collapse supernovae and Type Ia supernovae best explain observed elemental abundance ratios ([X/Fe]) and [Fe/H].

In this talk, I present highlight results from our analysis and discuss possible implications on the metal-enrichment sources at the birthplaces of the old stellar populations in the Galactic halo.

About 1% of red giants buck this trend, showing much more Li in their atmospheres than expected. These are the infamous 'Li-rich giants' which still evade explanation after about 4 decades. The traditional definition of Li-rich giants, that they have A(Li) > 1.5 dex, comes from stellar models which robustly show that Li is depleted to this amount through dilution, as the stars' convective envelopes deepen when they first become red giants. Recent work using asteroseismology has now shown that most of the Li-rich giants are in fact core helium-burning red clump (RC) stars, rather than RGB stars. Low-mass RGB stars are known to deplete Li further as they ascend the giant branch, reaching very low abundances (A(Li) ~ -1 dex). We use GALAH Li abundances combined with Gaia data and asteroseismic parameters to investigate Li evolution in low-mass stars. We find the usual low rates of traditionally-defined Li-rich giants. However we also find that the average A(Li) on the RC is substantially higher than at the RGB tip. One explanation for this is that Li is produced in most, if not all, low-mass stars, somewhere between the RGB tip and the RC. A(Li) appears to increase from the RGB tip to the RC by a factor of 40.</small></td>

I will present results from a recent study of 1262 lithium-rich giants in GALAH DR3. With a large data set we are able to expand on some previous literature results, finding significant differences in the occurrence rate of lithium richness as a function of metallicity for red giant branch versus red clump stars. We are also able to demonstrate that some stellar properties that have been claimed to be associated with lithium richness, including rotational velocity and infrared flux excess, are not effective predictors. While we do not arrive at a firm conclusion as to the physical mechanism(s) responsible for lithium enrichment in these stars, our analysis of the behaviour of the overall population can be used to inform models for that enrichment.</small></td>

One exciting feature of this result is that it gives astronomers for the first time a large sample of easily observable, unevolved stars that formed in an extra-Galactic environment, which can be compared to stars that formed within our Milky Way. In this talk I will discuss using these stars to investigate the "Spite Plateau" – the near-constant lithium abundance observed in metal-poor dwarf stars across a wide range of metallicities (-3<[Fe/H]<-1). In particular our aim was to test whether the stars that formed in Gaia-Enceladus show a different Spite Plateau to Milky Way stars that inhabit the disk and halo. Individual galaxies could have different Spite Plateaus – e.g., the interstellar medium could be more depleted in lithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir of gas. We find that the Gaia-Enceladus stars show the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in situ Milky Way stars, strongly suggesting that the "lithium problem" is not a consequence of the formation environment. This result fits within the growing consensus that the Spite Plateau, and more generally the "cosmological lithium problem" – the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm, metal-poor dwarf stars in our Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to have been produced by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis – is the result of lithium depletion processes within stars. </small></td>

We find that different stellar samples, even though they target different tracer populations and employ a variety of age estimation techniques, follow the same set of fundamental relations. We provide the clearest evidence to date that, in addition to the well-known dependence on stellar age, the velocity dispersions of stars depend on orbital angular momentum $L_z$, metallicity and height above the plane $|z|$, and are well described by a multiplicatively separable functional form. The dispersions have a power-law dependence on age with exponents of 0.441$\pm 0.007$ and 0.251$\pm 0.006$ for $\sigma_z$ and $\sigma_R$ respectively, and the power law is valid even for the oldest stars. For the solar neighborhood stars, the apparent break in the power law for older stars, as seen in previous studies, is due to the anti-correlation of $L_z$ with age. The dispersions decrease with increasing $L_z$ until we reach the Sun's orbital angular momentum, after which $\sigma_z$ increases  (implying flaring in the outer disc) while $\sigma_R$ flattens. For a given age, the dispersions increase with decreasing metallicity, suggesting that the dispersions increase with birth radius. The dispersions also increase linearly with $|z|$. The same set of relations that work in the solar neighborhood also work for stars between $3<R/{\rm kpc}<20$. Finally, the high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars follow the same relations as the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars.

Instead of estimate individual ages for the stars, we have applied a new method for estimating the sample age-metallicity distribution by combining the age-metallicity probability densities of individual stars.
In this talk I will present the results of applying this method to the full GALAH turnoff sample as well as subsamples divided by their kinematics and Galactic positions.
The age-metallicity distribution of the full sample shows more structure than previous studies of the Galactic disc, including a minimum in the age distribution at about 5 Gyr and a bimodality at high metallicities.
These results are related to recent models of formation and chemical evolution of the Galactic disc.</small></td>

For instance, in the last decade, the symbiosis between spectroscopy and asteroseismology has provided important benefits for both disciplines. On the one hand, asteroseismic constraints on the surface gravity of stars were instrumental in improving the accuracy of spectroscopic analysis. On the other hand, detailed information on the photospheric chemical composition is an essential ingredient for the inference of stellar population properties based on asteroseismology.

Since the first studies based on simple scaling relations between the global properties of the oscillation spectra and the parameters of stars exhibiting stochastic-type oscillations, significant improvements have been made thanks to a better understanding of the limitations of these scaling relations, and of the detailed structure of the oscillation spectra.  

In this contribution, we will present the work that our group has carried out in the last year, which has allowed a more precise characterisation of the stellar component of the thin and thick discs, and also a small fraction of the Milky Way halo. To this end, we have exploited different levels of information from the oscillation spectra (global oscillation properties with corrections based on theoretical models and individual oscillation frequencies) of Kepler red giants, in combination with chemical composition and radial velocity from APOGEE spectra.  We will also show the potential of oscillation spectra of red giants observed by the TESS space telescope. Although these spectra are less accurate than those obtained by Kepler, they can still provide precise estimates of the stellar parameters, if combined with spectroscopic data and Gaia-eDR3 parallaxes.

Current methods for estimating chemical abundances from stellar spectra make use of synthetic stellar spectra. This reliance on synthetic spectra, because of a mismatch with observations, limits the precision with which abundances can be estimated.  Therefore, we are motivated to work with the spectra directly to capture and compare the chemical information in stars. In this talk I will present results on recovering chemically identical stars from stellar spectra alone. We employ metric learning to project spectra directly into a lower dimensional subspace which we use to encode a chemical distance between stars. Our approach rests on the assumption that, after suitable pre-processing to isolate chemical variance, stars within open-clusters can be identified directly from their spectra, given their near-identical chemical compositions. Therefore, a model trained to recognize open-cluster members provides a mapping to recover chemically identical stars. We demonstrate our approach on the APOGEE dataset. We identify held out open cluster stars with higher efficiency with our data-driven spectra approach, compared to when using stellar abundance measurements. We quantify our performance using the reference of field stars that are found to be as chemically similar as open cluster stars: with our method, only 0.6\% of field stars appear as chemically similar as birth siblings compared to 1.7\% when using stellar abundance labels.

However, a prediction of simulations is that the fraction of metal-poor stars that are very old is highest towards the centres of galaxies: in their bulges. Searching for metal-poor stars in the inner Milky Way faces many challenges and much is unknown about the properties of the metal-poor inner Galaxy.

In this presentation, I will describe the Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) which has reached unprecedented efficiency in finding very metal-poor stars in the bulge region, employing metallicity-sensitive photometry to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up. I will focus on recent PIGS results regarding the occurrence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the inner Galaxy. CEMP stars are very abundant in the halo at low metallicities and contain clues about the First Stars and/or about binary interactions. Previously only a handful of CEMP stars were known in the inner Galaxy, but we have discovered many more in PIGS.

There are many ongoing efforts to search these data for stellar substructures to find evidence of individual accretion events that built up the Milky Way and its halo. One of these newly identified features, called Nyx, was announced as an accreted stellar stream traveling in the plane of the disk. Using a combination of elemental abundances and stellar parameters from the GALAH and APOGEE surveys, we find that the abundances of the highest likelihood Nyx members are entirely consistent with membership of the thick disk, and inconsistent with a dwarf galaxy origin. We conclude that the postulated Nyx stream is most probably a high-velocity component of the Milky Way's thick disk. With the growing availability of large data sets including kinematics, stellar parameters, and detailed abundances, the probability of detecting chance associations increases, and hence new searches for substructure require confirmation across as many data dimensions as possible.</small></td>

To test this idea, we construct a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for both simulated and observed stars in the Solar neighborhood, using measured velocities and iron abundances (i.e., an augmented Toomre diagram) as the distributions to be decomposed. We compare results for the Gaia-APOGEE DR16 crossmatch catalog of the Solar neighborhood with those from a suite of synthetic Gaia-APOGEE crossmatches constructed from FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. We find that in both the synthetic and real data, the best-fit GMM uses five independent components, some of whose properties resemble the standard populations predicted by galaxy formation theory. Two components can be identified unambiguously as the thin disk and another as the halo. However, instead of a single counterpart to the thick disk, there are three intermediate components with different age and alpha abundance distributions (although these data are not used to construct the model). We use decompositions of the synthetic data to show that the classified components indeed correspond to stars with different origins. By analogy with the simulated data, we show that our mixture model of the real Gaia-APOGEE crossmatch distinguishes the following components: (1) a classic thin disk of young stars on circular orbits (46%), (2) thin disk stars heated by interactions with satellites (22%), (3, 4) two components representing the velocity asymmetry of the alpha-enhanced thick disk (27%), and (5) a stellar halo consistent with early, massive accretion (4%).</small></td>

with stellar age, leading to the possibility of using stellar atmospheric
abundances as stellar age indicators. These chemical clocks have been
calibrated with solar-twins, open clusters and red giants, but it remains to be
seen whether they can be effective at identifying coeval stars in a field
population that spans a broad parameter space (i.e., the promise of chemical
tagging). Since the components of wide binaries are known to be stars of common
origins, they constitute ideal laboratories for testing the usefulness of
chemical clocks for the age dating of field stars. We determined the abundances
of a new sample of 5 binaries and collected data for other 31 systems from the
literature in order to test the applicability of chemical clocks. We recover
the well known result that the components of wide binaries have more consistent
chemistry than that of random pairs. However, we also show for the first time
that abundance ratios designed as chemical clocks are even more consistent
among the components of wide binaries than their [X/Fe] ratios. Not only that,
but the special case of the pair HIP 34426/HIP 34407 may indicate that chemical
clocks are consistent for coeval stars even when the individual abundances are
not. If the assumption that chemical clocks are reliable age indicators is
correct, this would constitute first quantitative, statistically significant
evidence that the components of wide binaries in the Galactic field are indeed
coeval, validating a large body of published work that relies on that to be the
case. Moreover, our results provide strong evidence that chemical clocks indeed
carry important information about stellar birthplaces and chemical evolution,
and thus we propose that including them in chemical tagging efforts may
facilitate the identification of nowadays dissolved stellar groups.</small></td>

        <td>Gas phase metallicity history of Milky Way-like galaxies across cosmic time<br/><small><i>This talk was not recorded.</i><br/>The knowledge of the ISM metal history is crucial to understand GALAH observations that constrain the galactic chemical evolution of the Milky Way. To this effect, we develop and present a new model for the evolution of spatially resolved ISM metallicities in Milky Way-like galaxies from first principles. We show that ISM metallicities depend on four ratios that collectively describe the metal equilibration time-scale, production, transport, consumption, and loss. When normalized by metal diffusion, metallicity gradients in Milky Way-like galaxies are governed by the competition between radial advection and accretion of metal-poor gas from the cosmic web, both of which mix metals to flatten the gradients, as opposed to metal production which promotes the development of steep gradients. We use the model to study the cosmic evolution of spatially resolved metallicities across redshift, showing that the metallicity gradient in Milky Way-like galaxies has steepened over time, in good agreement with both observations and simulations. Our model also predicts that Milky Way-like galaxies had more metal enriched outflows in the past. Reproducing the observed mass-metallicity and mass-metallicity gradient relations in the local Universe from the model reveals that Milky Way-like galaxies transition from the metal advection-dominated to the gas accretion-dominated regime as they increase in mass. This transition mirrors the transition observed in the dominant source of turbulence in the disc, from gravity-driven at high redshifts to star formation feedback-driven at low redshifts. The model can be self-consistently incorporated into existing Galactic archaeology models that study radial migration, as well as the formation of the thin and the thick discs, and thus has the potential to further contribute to our understanding of Galactic chemical evolution.</small></td>

The Gaia-Enceladus stars clearly show higher abundance of an r-process element with respect to an element formed by core-collapse supernovae. Three massive dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way are also known to show similar r-process enhancements. We show that a simple chemical evolution model that considers r-process enrichments by neutron star mergers can naturally explain the high r-process element abundance of these four galaxies. The high r-process element abundances are a consequence of lower star formation in these galaxies than the Milky Way and the delay time of neutron star mergers.</small></td>

Starting from a list of halo main sequence stars in Gaia eDR3 selected using the reduced proper motion method, we infer the metallicity information from the very-metallicity sensitive Pristine survey. This results in a set of ~0.76M stars with reliable photometric metallicities as well as distance estimates – the typical distance uncertainty for these stars is 7% and the heliocentric distance ranges between 0 and 21 kpc with a mean of 7 kpc, thereby probing much further out than would be possible using reliable Gaia parallaxes. From the distribution of binned velocity moments in the sky, several stream-like features stand out at higher distances in this sample.

We study the metallicity structure of the halo in different distance slices and map out the metal-poor Milky Way halo across various lines of sight. Our results confirm an overall metallicity distribution function (MDF) of the local halo population with a peak at [Fe/H]=-1.6, consistent with literature results. We trace a probable extension of Phlegethon stream and another sub-structure that crosses Phlegethon from the [Fe/H]<-2 metallicity space in the sky.

The high-resolution surveys provide detailed chemical fingerprints for each program star, typically measuring 15-30 elements per star. A key question to these surveys is how many of these elements actually contain independent information. It has long been recognized that the ratio of alpha-elements to iron peak elements is an important dimension of stellar abundance variation in addition to overall metallicity. However, the evidence on variations beyond the metallicity and alpha-enhancement is mixed. Some studies of stars' multi-element abundance distributions suggest at least 5-7 significant dimensions, but others show that many elemental abundances can be predicted to high accuracy from [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] (or [Fe/H] and age) alone. In this talk, I will reconcile these seemingly contradictory results. I will show that both propositions can be, and are, simultaneously true. In particular, I will discuss, although one could infer elemental abundances to high accuracy with only [Fe/H] and [Alpha/Fe] elements, residual abundances can display clear correlations between other elements, which signal cannot be explained by only two elements. I will demonstrate that cross-element correlations are a much more sensitive probe of hidden structure than dispersion, and they can be measured precisely in a large sample even if star-by-star measurement noise is comparable to the intrinsic scatter. In short, many elements have an independent story to tell, even for the "mundane'' disk stars and elements produced by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. The only way to learn these lessons is to measure the abundances directly, and not merely infer them.

Accurately and correctly capturing and explaining the detailed features in the high-quality observational data is notoriously difficult for state-of-the-art numerical models.
In order to keep up with the quantity and quality of observational datasets, improved prescriptions for galactic chemical evolution need to be incorporated into the simulations.
Here we present a new, flexible, time resolved chemical enrichment model for cosmological simulations. Our model allows to easily change a number of stellar physics parameters such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar lifetimes, chemical yields or SN Ia delay times. We implement our model into the Gasoline2 code and perform a series of cosmological simulations varying a number of key parameters, foremost evaluating different stellar yield sets for massive stars from the literature.
We find that total metallicity, total iron abundance and gas phase oxygen abundance are robust predictions from different yield sets and in agreement with observational relations. On the other hand, individual element abundances, especially alpha-elements show significant differences across different yield sets and none of our models can simultaneously match constraints on the dwarf and MW mass scale. This offers a unique way of observationally constraining model parameters. For MW mass galaxies we find for most yield tables tested in this work a bimodality in the [\alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] plane of rather low intrinsic scatter potentially in tension with the observed abundance scatter. </small></td>

The comparison with stellar evolution models confirms that classical models cannot reproduce the lithium abundances observed in the metallicity and mass regimes covered by the data.
   The models that include  the effects of both rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline instability account for the Li abundance trends observed in our sample, in all metallicity and mass ranges.  The differences between the results of the classical models and of the rotation models largely differ (up to ~2 dex), making  lithium the best element to constrain stellar mixing processes  in low-mass stars. We discuss the Li abundances in the red clump stars, confirming that a large fraction of them have A(Li) higher than expected by models, and than some mixing episodes might be necessary during the He-flash phase.  </small></td>

Indeed, we are in a golden era for this field of  research thanks to the advent of large spectroscopic surveys, such as GALAH. In this way, detailed stellar abundances of stars in the Milky Way can be measured. Then, by  means of detailed chemical evolution models, it is possible to predict the chemical abundances expected in the stars of each Galactic component: halo, thick disc, thin disc and bulge. From the comparison between data and model predictions for different chemical elements from lithium to europium, we can reconstruct the history of star formation occurred in each component, and thus the history of formation and evolution of the entire Galaxy.</small></td>

        <td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWEkfCmdg3c">Galactic evolution of lithium from GES iDR6</a><br/><small>We use a sample of open cluster and field stars for which high-precision 7Li abundances and stellar parameters are homogeneously derived by the Gaia-ESO Survey to trace the evolution of lithium in the Milky Way thick and thin discs. We confirm previous findings that the abundance of 7Li in the solar neighbourhood does not decrease at super-solar metallicities. The comparison of the data with theoretical predictions from Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models favours a scenario in which the majority of 7Li in the Galaxy comes from nova outbursts. Current data seem to suggest that the nova rate flattens out at later times. If confirmed, this may have implications for the masses of the white dwarf nova progenitors that deserve further investigations. To conclude, we comment on the possible use of 7Li data gathered by GALAH to further constrain our GCE models.</small></td>

Adopting stellar yields from Kobayashi et al. (2020, 10.3847/1538-4357/abae65), we created a multi-zone chemical evolution model that incorporates radial inflow and radial migration. The chemical evolution tracks for different radial zones serve as direct comparison to the analytic tracks extracted from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) in Sharma et al. (2020, arXiv:2005.03646). Our model found qualitative agreement with key features seen in observations and extends the work of Schoenrich & Binney (2009) and Andrews et. al. (2015). The code will be made public soon. </small></td>
