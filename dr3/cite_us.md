We also ask that you include the following acknowledgement in your works:

> This work made use of the Third Data Release of the GALAH Survey (Buder et al 2021). The GALAH Survey is based on data acquired through the Australian Astronomical Observatory, under programs: A/2013B/13 (The GALAH pilot survey); A/2014A/25, A/2015A/19, A2017A/18 (The GALAH survey phase 1); A2018A/18 (Open clusters with HERMES); A2019A/1 (Hierarchical star formation in Ori OB1); A2019A/15 (The GALAH survey phase 2); A/2015B/19, A/2016A/22, A/2016B/10, A/2017B/16, A/2018B/15 (The HERMES-TESS program); and A/2015A/3, A/2015B/1, A/2015B/19, A/2016A/22, A/2016B/12, A/2017A/14 (The HERMES K2-follow-up program). We acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which the AAT stands, the Gamilaraay people, and pay our respects to elders past and present. This paper includes data that has been provided by AAO Data Central (datacentral.aao.gov.au).

The GALAH Survey relies on the work of the Gaia mission, so please consider including [their acknowledgements](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/documentation/GEDR3/Miscellaneous/sec_credit_and_citation_instructions/):

>This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission Gaia (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia), processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC, https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium). Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the Gaia Multilateral Agreement.
