{: .main_blockquote}
The overarching goal of GALAH is to reveal the rich history of our Milky Way Galaxy by studying the current positions, motions, ages and chemistry of stars formed at different times and in different locations. It is closely related to the study of the origin of the elements: when, where, and how the different elements were produced throughout the history of the cosmos.

### Overview

How galaxies form and evolve across cosmic time is one of the major research questions in modern astronomy and cosmology ([Australian Decadal Plan for 2016-2025](https://www.science.org.au/supporting-science/science-sector-analysis/reports-and-publications/decadal-plan-australian-astronomy-2016-25)). Key aspects of the origin and evolution of galaxies are poorly understood, but studying our own Galaxy offers one of our best opportunities at understanding spiral galaxies more generally; a near-field approach to cosmology. However, understanding the formation history of the Galaxy is a challenging puzzle.

The present state of the Galaxy is a result of various complex physical processes occurring simultaneously over its lifetime. The situation is further complicated by the fact that we only have access to the current snapshot of the Galaxy. Fortunately, encoded in the light of the stars are clues that nature has left for us to solve this puzzle. The chemical compositions of stars are shaped by events from the Big Bang through nuclear burning in successive generations of stars until the present day. Because the elements have distinct nucleosynthetic origins in different types of stars with varying lifetimes, the combination of many stellar elemental abundances allows astronomers to tag individual stars to their place of birth and the physical conditions prevailing at that time. The age of a star can be estimated using information in stellar spectra. Furthermore, kinematic data carries information about past episodes of accretion and heating as well as resonances and other drivers of migration in the disk.

The April 2018 release of Gaia DR2 has been a game changer in the field of Galactic science. In particular, the parallax measurements from Gaia allow the identification of main sequence turnoff and subgiant stars (MSTO), and determination of their ages to 10% precision. Obtaining ages for a large number of stars adds to our existing dataset and enables a wide range of projects that shed light on several outstanding questions in stellar and Galactic science.

**Having precise age estimates for a large number of stars adds new dimensionality to previous work, and opens up a new realm of possibilities that we aim to explore in GALAH. Below we focus on some main science drivers that benefit from having precise ages.**


### GALAH Survey Science goals

<!-- Stars form on circular orbits close to the plane of the disc and their initial distribution can be represented as a function of only time and formation radius. Over time these orbits become eccentric and the stars migrate and mix along all three spatial dimensions, leading to their present state, which is determined by dynamical evolution. The formation radius is not directly observable but for a given age, the elemental abundances vary with radius depending upon the star formation history, nucleosynthesis and the infall of fresh gas. Elemental abundances are tags that help us to tie the stars to their place of birth. Given age and birth radius, chemical evolution models can predict the distribution of elemental abundances and orbital properties. The goal of Galactic archaeology is to understand both the initial conditions and the processes governing their evolution. To do this we need to create a dense observational dataset of that has precise values, spans a wide region of the Galaxy, and contains stars of all ages and compositions. -->

#### The Origin of the High- and Low-α Sequences

In the solar neighbourhood, there is a clear dichotomy between two sequences in the [α/Fe]–[Fe/H] abundance space: a high-[α/Fe] sequence and a low-[α/Fe] sequence, traditionally referred to as the thick and thin discs. The origin of these two sequences has proven difficult to explain, and has lead to increasingly complicated models of chemical evolution. It is also possible that these two sequences are (partly) coeval, reflecting instead the chemical evolution of different areas of the Galaxy. Existing observations are inadequate to disentangle the origin of these two populations. A region of particular interest is right on the boundary between the two sequences and where the two sequences begin to merge. With our current data, there are only a handful of stars between 8 and 9 Gyrs, which is not enough to determine the origin of the different populations.

#### Is the SFH of the Milky Way continuous, or is it split into distinct episodes?
This is an unresolved question. Some studies suggest that there is a quenching of star formation at around 8-10 Gyr, and this is linked to the origin of the thick disc, while others suggest a continuous star formation history. Precise ages for a large number of stars can directly answer this question. A number of recent studies suggest that using chemical evolution models one can fit for trends of some specific elemental abundances with age and recover the SFH.

#### Understanding Radial Mixing
Different radial mixing processes bring metal-rich/-poor stars from the inner/outer regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood. Hence, the metallicity distribution of stars in the solar neighbourhood can be used to place constraints on the amount of radial mixing. Elements other than iron are also useful for this purpose. However, the relative efficiency and time scales of different mixing processes (i.e., blurring vs. churning) are unknown. If we have age information for a large number of stars, we can study radial mixing as a function of time and provide tighter constraints to models of Galaxy evolution.

#### Chemical Tagging
Elemental abundances are birth tags that cannot be erased unlike kinematic or positional information. This leads to the elegant notion of using elemental abundances patterns to identify stars sharing a common origin. Recent studies on the practicality of chemical tagging have been encouraging. Previous research has looked at the theoretical capabilities of chemical tagging in a large dataset to investigate the connections between data quality, survey size, and level of recovered detail on the star formation history. In the thick disk specifically, it has been calculated that for a mock GALAH survey with one million stars, we should detect ten stars (a reasonable minimum number for confident chemical tagging) for all clusters down to an initial cluster mass of 105&nbsp;M<sub>◉</sub>. The initial cluster mass function has a negative slope, meaning that there are more low-mass star-forming groups than high-mass ones. Increasing the size of the GALAH sample reduces the minimum cluster mass that can be resolved by GALAH, meaning that we can track the star formation history of the disk more completely. These predictions underline that our sample size and data quality goals have real consequences for the scientific capabilities of our project.

#### Kinematic Substructures

Gaia has revealed the velocity space in the solar neighborhood to be rich with substructure, showing numerous clumps belonging to various moving groups. It has already been shown with GALAH data, these moving groups have unique chemical signatures. However, we currently do not have a large enough sample size to resolve these substructures by age, which can reveal the origin of these structures, e.g., orbital resonances due to bar or spiral arms, disruption of large clusters or star forming complexes, or outside perturbations
