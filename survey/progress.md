{: .main_blockquote}
The nominal aim of the GALAH survey is a sample of one million stars. The main observing programme started on 7 February 2014 and up to the night of 24 March 2021 we have acquired 754470 spectra from 693878 stars.

This page presents the observing progress of the GALAH survey.

### Number of stars observed

GALAH has acquired 754470 spectra from 693878 stars. Above is the cumulative sum with time for the number of spectra and the number of stars. Unflagged refers to those targets where there is no problem noted with the reduction. The vertical grey stripes indicate observing nights.

The GALAH survey consists of three main surveys: GALAH, K2-HERMES, and TESS-HERMES. There was also a smaller program dedicated to open clusters. Below is the cumulative sum of spectra acquired for each sub-survey.

### Observing time

![Number of publications using GALAH](/survey/img/survey_progress_useful_night_fraction.svg){:width="100%"}
The GALAH survey has used 621 nights on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Above is the distribution of the useful fraction of each night used (*defining night as the time between astronomical twilight*). We acquired no star spectra on 150 of these nights (mostly due to weather loss or technical reasons). For 58% of nights, we used at least half of the night.

The cumulative sum of total shutter-open time used by the GALAH Survey. The vertical grey stripes indicate observing nights.

![Number of publications using GALAH](/survey/img/survey_progress_stars_per_hour.svg){:width="100%"}
The average number of spectra acquired per shutter open time. For most of the survey, we typically observed a field of 350 stars for one hour. The decrease in 2020 is due to a change in our observing strategy that increased the exposure time per field.
